To-Do List Application

The To-Do List Application is a simple Java program that helps you keep track of your tasks. 
Whether you need to jot down reminders, mark things as done, or update your to-dos, this app makes it easy. 
You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit details, and delete them when they're no longer needed. 
Depending on your preference, the app can be used as a basic console application or with a graphical interface using Swing or JavaFX.
This project is built using Java, 
and you can choose to store tasks in a file or a database if you want to save them for later. 
Once you're up and running, just follow the menu options to add, mark, edit, or delete tasks. 
It's a straightforward tool to help you stay organized.
